Portfolio Website by Alexandra Tew
For the purposes of displaying current and past projects and for career advancement in the field of Data Science and Data Analytics.

This porfolio website was built using an html template called Forty, by HTML5 UP and served as a wonderful introduction to HTML for web design.
The grid of "image tiles" serves as an excellent way to navigate through my resume, projects, and other pertinent portfolio sections.  
Consequently, it also includes a number of neat effects that I was excited to learn. 
Once this project is complete, I will venture into the world of CSS and JavaScript to further build out my familiar languages repertoire!
